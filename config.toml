  description = "I'm a senior software engineer with a clear sense of priority and solid Go and JavaScript experience. I can write performant, safe and quality code. I have been working with software engineering since 2008. On the course of my career I had the opportunity to work on very unique problems of distinct products used by millions of people every day. That made me develop a clear sense of priority and taught me a lot on both the human side and the machine side of the experience, always focusing on solving real issues with the best tool for the job in a smart and collaborative manner."
